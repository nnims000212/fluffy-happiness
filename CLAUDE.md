# Development Partnership

We're building production-quality code together. Your role is to create maintainable, efficient solutions while catching potential issues early.

## üö® AUTOMATED CHECKS ARE MANDATORY
**ALL hook issues are BLOCKING - EVERYTHING must be ‚úÖ GREEN!**  
No errors. No formatting issues. No linting problems. Zero tolerance.  
These are not suggestions. Fix ALL issues before continuing.

## CRITICAL WORKFLOW - ALWAYS FOLLOW THIS!

### Research ‚Üí Plan ‚Üí Implement
**NEVER JUMP STRAIGHT TO CODING!** Always follow this sequence:
1. **Research**: Explore the codebase, understand existing patterns
2. **Plan**: Create a detailed implementation plan and verify it with me  
3. **Implement**: Execute the plan with validation checkpoints

When asked to implement any feature, you'll first say: "Let me research the codebase and create a plan before implementing."

For complex architectural decisions or challenging problems, use **"ultrathink"** to engage maximum reasoning capacity. Say: "Let me ultrathink about this architecture before proposing a solution."

### USE MULTIPLE AGENTS!
*Leverage subagents aggressively* for better results:

* Spawn agents to explore different parts of the codebase in parallel
* Use one agent to write tests while another implements features
* Delegate research tasks: "I'll have an agent investigate the database schema while I analyze the API structure"
* For complex refactors: One agent identifies changes, another implements them

Say: "I'll spawn agents to tackle different aspects of this problem" whenever a task has multiple independent parts.

### Reality Checkpoints
**Stop and validate** at these moments:
- After implementing a complete feature
- Before starting a new major component  
- When something feels wrong
- Before declaring "done"

## Working Memory Management

### When context gets long:
- Re-read this CLAUDE.md file
- Summarize progress in a PROGRESS.md file
- Document current state before major changes

### Maintain TODO.md:
```
## Current Task
- [ ] What we're doing RIGHT NOW

## Completed  
- [x] What's actually done and tested

## Next Steps
- [ ] What comes next
```


## Performance & Security

### **Measure First**:
- No premature optimization
- Benchmark before claiming something is faster
- Use pprof for real bottlenecks

### **Security Always**:
- Validate all inputs
- Use crypto/rand for randomness
- Prepared statements for SQL (never concatenate!)

## Communication Protocol

### Progress Updates:
```
‚úì Implemented authentication (all tests passing)
‚úì Added rate limiting  
‚úó Found issue with token expiration - investigating
```

### Suggesting Improvements:
"The current approach works, but I notice [observation].
Would you like me to [specific improvement]?"

## Working Together

- This is always a feature branch - no backwards compatibility needed
- When in doubt, we choose clarity over cleverness

- **REMINDER**: If this file hasn't been referenced in 30+ minutes, RE-READ IT!

Avoid complex abstractions or "clever" code. The simple, obvious solution is probably better, and my guidance helps you stay focused on what matters.

## Development Commands

## Application Overview

This is a comprehensive focus timer application built with React, TypeScript, and Vite. It provides time tracking, task management, project organization, and detailed analytics through a single-page application with five main sections: Home (dashboard), Top 3 (daily planning), Timer (focus sessions), To-do (task management), and History (session management).

## Architecture Overview

### State Management Architecture
The app uses React Context API with a centralized `AppContext` that manages all application state:
- **Sessions**: Focus/timer sessions with timing, task names, projects, and session notes
- **Todos**: Task management with project categorization, notes, and focus prioritization
- **Projects**: User-defined project categories with notes and archiving capabilities
- **Navigation**: Single-page app with 5 main pages (Home, Top 3, Timer, To-do, History)
- **Daily Work Goals**: User-configurable daily work hour targets with settings UI
- **Active States**: Currently tracked todo and selected todo for seamless workflow

### Data Persistence
All data is persisted to localStorage through the `useLocalStorage` hook, which:
- Automatically serializes/deserializes data including Date objects
- Handles corrupted data gracefully by clearing and resetting to defaults
- Uses a custom date reviver to properly restore Date objects from JSON
- Implements automatic cleanup of soft-deleted todos after 30 days
- Supports data migration for legacy project formats
- Stores user preferences including daily work goal settings

## Data Types & Relationships

### Session Interface
```typescript
interface Session {
    id: string;              // Unique identifier for reliable updates
    startTime: Date;         // When the session started
    durationMs: number;      // Duration in milliseconds
    description: string;     // Task name/description
    project: string;         // Associated project name
    todoId?: string | null;  // Optional link to Todo item
    notes?: string;          // Session-specific notes (separate from task name)
}
```

### Todo Interface
```typescript
interface Todo {
    id: string;              // Unique identifier
    text: string;            // Task description
    completed: boolean;      // Completion status
    projectId: string;       // Project association (empty string = no project)
    notes: string;           // Task notes
    completedAt?: Date;      // Completion timestamp
    deleted: boolean;        // Soft delete flag
    deletedAt?: Date;        // Deletion timestamp
    focusOrder?: number;     // Priority order (1, 2, or 3 for "Top 3 Focus")
}
```

### Project Interface
```typescript
interface Project {
    id: string;              // Unique identifier
    name: string;            // Project name
    notes: string;           // Project notes
    archived: boolean;       // Archive status
    archivedAt?: Date;       // Archive timestamp
    createdAt: Date;         // Creation timestamp
}
```

### Key Data Relationships
- **Sessions ‚Üî Todos**: Sessions can be linked to todos via `todoId` field
- **Todos ‚Üî Projects**: Todos are categorized by project via `projectId` (uses project name)
- **Sessions ‚Üî Projects**: Sessions are categorized by project via `project` field (uses project name)
- **Active todo state**: Shared between Timer and Todo pages for seamless workflow

- Only activates when viewing today in day view
- 100ms delay for proper layout calculation

**useLocalStorage (`src/hooks/useLocalStorage.ts`):**
- Handles all data persistence with automatic type safety
- Custom date reviver for JSON parsing
- Graceful error handling with fallback to defaults

**useDashboardData (`src/hooks/useDashboardData.ts`):**
- Processes session data for dashboard views
- Calculates project/task breakdowns and percentages
- Filters data by date range and view mode

### Utility Functions

**Formatters (`src/utils/formatters.ts`):**
- `formatToHoursAndMinutes()`: Converts milliseconds to "X hr Y min" format
- Date/time formatting with timezone support

**Colors (`src/utils/colors.ts`):**
- `getProjectColor()`: Consistent color assignment for projects
- Predefined colors for special categories
- Hash-based fallback for unknown projects

## Data Flow & Business Logic

### Session Creation Flow
1. **Timer Completion**: User starts timer ‚Üí session automatically created on completion
2. **Manual Entry**: User adds session via History page with full editing capability
3. **Stopwatch Tracking**: Linked todos from TodoPage start stopwatch automatically

### Auto-linking System
- **Todo Creation**: Starting timer with new task name creates todo automatically
- **Existing Matching**: Case-insensitive matching of task names to existing todos
- **Bidirectional Updates**: Sessions link to todos, todos show related sessions

### Notes System
- **Session Notes**: Separate from task names, editable in Previous Sessions
- **Task Notes**: Stored on todo items, editable in TodoPage
- **Current Session Notes**: Flow from active session to saved session notes

### Project Color System
- Consistent color mapping based on project order in global list
- Special handling for categories like "Focus", "Meetings", "Breaks"
- Color persistence across timeline, charts, and UI elements

## Local Storage Strategy

### Storage Keys
- `focusTimerSessions` - Array of Session objects
- `focusTimerProjects` - Array of Project objects (migrated from legacy string array)
- `focusTimerTodos` - Array of Todo objects
- `focusTimerDailyGoal` - Number representing daily work goal in hours (default: 8)

### Data Migration & Cleanup
- Automatic migration from legacy project format (string array to Project objects)
- Soft delete cleanup: Permanently removes todos deleted 30+ days ago
- Graceful handling of corrupted data with reset to defaults

## Working with the Codebase

### Adding New Features
1. Update types in `src/types.ts` if new data structures needed
2. Add state/actions to `AppContext.tsx` for global state management
3. Create/modify components following existing patterns
4. Use `useAppContext()` hook to access global state
5. Follow localStorage persistence patterns for data durability
6. Add appropriate TypeScript types for type safety

### Code Patterns
- **Context Pattern**: All global state managed through AppContext
- **Component Composition**: Reusable components with clear prop interfaces
- **Custom Hooks**: Extract complex logic into reusable hooks
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript types for all data structures

### Current Limitations & Technical Debt
- **Project Linking**: Mixed ID/name linking strategies create potential inconsistencies
- **Timeline View**: Only available in day view mode (week/month/year show summaries only)
- **Data Export**: No built-in export functionality
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Optimized primarily for desktop use
- **Complex Context**: Large context provider managing many responsibilities
- **Top 3 Persistence**: Top 3 Focus priorities persist indefinitely (no daily reset functionality)
