    <h1>Permanently Delete Functionality Test</h1>
    <p>This is a test file to investigate the permanently delete issue.</p>
    
    <h2>Analysis Summary:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>TodoItem component shows trash actions when todo.deleted is true</li>
        <li>Trash view filters todos to show only deleted items</li>
        <li>Permanently delete button calls permanentlyDeleteTodo function</li>
        <li>permanentlyDeleteTodo removes the todo from the array completely</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Potential Issues:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Check if todos are actually being marked as deleted: true</li>
        <li>Verify trash view is correctly filtering deleted todos</li>
        <li>Confirm TodoItem props are correctly passed in trash view</li>
        <li>Check if hideProjectBadge prop is interfering with trash actions</li>
    </ul>
